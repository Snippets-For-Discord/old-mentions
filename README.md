## Applying the Snippet
For the people who would like to use this in their themes:
- You can copy-paste the code into your own source, simple.
- Please give credit, whether it's in the README.md or in the source, please make sure you give credit for using this. If you don't, then oh well that's just.. RIP.

For the people who just want the snippet itself:
- Follow the directions below "**Installation**" for the process of installing the snippet based on the client mod you're using. Either that or you can go into `./src/index.css` and copy-paste it into your Quick CSS (or whatever you use).
